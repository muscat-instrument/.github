# Welcome to the MUSCAT GitHub
MUSCAT is a kilopixel 1.1 mm receiver on the [Large Millimeter Telescope](www.lmtgtm.org/). MUSCAT has recently been installed and is currently undergoing final-stage on-sky commissioning. We will soon start to provide some tool for status monitoring and data reduction here. In the mean time if you have any ideas please raise an [issue](https://github.com/muscat-instrument/readme/issues) on this repo for now and will we have a little rearrange when everything gets set up.

In the meantime, why not check out our [website](https://muscat.astro.cf.ac.uk).
