# Welcome to the MUSCAT GitHub
We are currently finishing the lab testing of MUSCAT and hope to ship the instrument in the coming weeks. We will soon start to provide some tool for status monitoring and data reduction here. In the mean time if you have any ideas please raise an [issue](https://github.com/muscat-instrument/readme/issues) on this repo for now and will we have a little rearrange when everything gets set up.

In the meantime, why not check out our [website](https://muscat.astro.cf.ac.uk).
